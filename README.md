A real-time contest platform with integrated blog and editorial support, designed for maths, logic, technology, and problem-solving content. Perfect for hosting competitive quizzes, sharing solutions, and engaging with a community of thinkers.

## Features

**Real-time leaderboard**  
Watch scores update instantly while the contest is still going on. No refreshing, no delays.

**Math-friendly questions**  
Supports KaTeX (rendering LaTeX-style math), so you can throw in all the fancy equations and symbols you want without them looking ugly.

**Simple contest management (Currently Limited)**  
Admins can create contests, set questions, control start/end times, and run the whole show from behind the scenes.

**LaTeX-supported-Blogs**  
Users can publish blogs to share knowledge, strategies, or problem explanations.

**Post-contest answers**  
After a contest ends, participants can still submit the questions and get the results — just don’t expect the leaderboard to move anymore.

**Clean, responsive UI**  
Built with Next.js, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui so it looks good on different screens.

## Coming Soon
**Admin approval system**  
Admins can be approved and then host contests for everyone to join.

**Tags for everything**  
Tag contests and blogs with categories like Maths, Technology, or Physics so people can find exactly what they want.

**AI-generated questions**  
Get automatically generated questions powered by AI to keep contests fresh and challenging.
